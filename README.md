# Mini-Project-Web-Services

<h2>Project Definition :file_folder:</h2>

**Objectives**

The main objective of this task is to provide the students with practical experience in creating and integrating small-scale enterprise applications with a service-oriented architecture.



<h3>Tasks</h3>

1.    Create at least one SOAP-based and at least one RESTful web services, which deliver resources, valuable for a selected business. 

2.    Deploy the services on either a local or a remote server.

3.    Create a client application consuming the web services.



<h3>Requirements</h3>

* This project is mandatory. It is a teamwork. Recommended average size of a group is 3 students. 
* There is no requirement for using specific programming languages or development environments.
* The client application is business-oriented.
* The client application may invoke additional web services from public repositories.

The project contains a readme.txt file with the following attributes:

* authors’ details
* brief summary of application development and implementation, including both business and technical features
* installation instructions


Presentation and Demonstration
The project solutions are subject to public presentation in class on 26/09/2019, according the plan.

We've been working with both SOAP and REST webservices in this assignment. Otherthen creating webservices we also consumed them with clients and took use of the methods. 
The logic within the webservices is business related.

<h3>Generel</h3>
1. Clone the project to your computuer.

<h3>SOAP</h3>

1. _**(Optional)**_ Open the project "Mini Project - Web Services - Soap api" and Investigate: WebService1.asmx.cs and the model classes.
2. Open the project "Mini Project - Web Services - Client Winform SOAP" and RUN it. _you don't have to run the SOAP before, because its hosted on Azure and consumed with the client._
3. Follow the numbers 1-5 to see the functionallity work (the usage of the SOAP). ATTENTION! the program is case sensetive. 

_**You can also open the project "Mini Project - Web Services - Client" if you want it in a console format instead._

<h3>REST</h3>

1. _**(Optional)**_ Open the project "Mini Project - Web Services - REST api" and Investigate: WebService1.asmx.cs, the model classes and controllers _if you want_.
2. Open the project "Mini Project - Web Services - Client Winform REST" and RUN it.
3. Follow the numbers 1-5 to see the functionallity work (the usage of the REST).
